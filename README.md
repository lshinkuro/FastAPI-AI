FastAPI Project

This project is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Requirements

Python 3.7+
FastAPI
Uvicorn
Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Replace username and repository-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. Navigate to the project directory
bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for the project:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)
source env/bin/activate

# On Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate
4. Install dependencies
Install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can install FastAPI and Uvicorn manually:

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn
5. Run the application
Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application. Replace app:app with the correct path to your FastAPI app.

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The --reload flag will automatically reload the server when you make changes to the code.

6. Access the API
Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

bash
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000
You can also view the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at:

bash
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Alternatively, you can use the ReDoc documentation at:

bash
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
